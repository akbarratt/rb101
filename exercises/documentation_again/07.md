*Use irb to run the following code:*

```Ruby
s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods.inspect
```

*You should find that it prints a list of all of the public methods available to the String s; this includes not only those methods defined in the String class, but also methods that are inherited from Object (which inherits other methods from the BasicObject class and the Kernel module). That's a lot of methods.*

*How would you modify this code to print just the public methods that are defined or overridden by the String class? That is, the list should exclude all members that are only defined in Object, BasicObject, and Kernel.*

```Ruby
puts s.public_methods(false).inspect
```

The documentation for public_methods falls under Object. Even there we aren't given much information on how to solve this problem. By looking at the method signature, we see that public_methods has an optional parameter that defaults to true. By specifying a false parameter, we get a list that does NOT contain all public methods.
