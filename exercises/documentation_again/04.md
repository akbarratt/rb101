*The `Array#bsearch` method is used to search ordered `Array`s more quickly than `#find` and `#select` can. Assume you have the following code:*

```Ruby
a = [1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19]
```

*How would you search this `Array` to find the first element whose value exceeds `8`?*

```Ruby
a.bsearch { |x| x > 8 }
# 11
```

Binary search is often faster and more efficient than other search methods but requires that the array be ordered to work.
