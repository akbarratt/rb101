*Consider the following method and a call to that method:*
```Ruby
def my_method(a, b = 2, c = 3, d)
  p [a, b, c, d]
end

my_method(4, 5, 6)
```
*Use the ruby documentation to determine what this code will print.*

```Ruby
# [4, 5, 3, 6]
```

In Ruby, default arguments are allowed only in groups, but these groups are allowed to occur in the middle. While the documentation doesn't go into detail on how Ruby fills in these variables and deals with defaults when more arguments are given than there are arguments without a default value, we can use the example given to determine that this will be the result.
