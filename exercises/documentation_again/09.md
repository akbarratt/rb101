*Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head.*

*In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with YAML::load_file:*

```Ruby
require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')
```

*Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.*

YAML is located in the Standard Library, which is separate from Ruby Core. However, the method we're looking for isn't listed on YAML's page in the documentation. The YAML object page says "As the implementation is provided by the Psych library, detailed documentation can be found in that libraryâ€™s docs (also part of standard library)." That's where the documentation can be found.
