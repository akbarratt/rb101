## Process the Problem
Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns a string of alternating 1s and 0s, always starting with 1. The length of the string should match the given integer.

Input: positive integer
Output: string of integers

Rules
- Output must always start with 1
- Output must alternate 1s and 0s
  - This means even numbers end in 0 and odd numbers end in 1
- Integer input must be positive
- String.length should be equal to the integer given

## Examples
puts stringy(6) == '101010'
puts stringy(9) == '101010101'
puts stringy(4) == '1010'
puts stringy(7) == '1010101'

## Data Structures
- array
- loop
Example: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0].join

## Algorithm

Given an input number, initialize an empty array. Then inside of a loop, the integers 1 and 0 should alternately be pushed to the array, always starting with 1, until the length of the array is equal to the input integer. The array should finally be collapsed and returned as a string.
