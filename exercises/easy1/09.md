## Problem
Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of its digits. For a challenge, try writing this without any basic looping constructs (while, until, loop, and each).

Input: integer
Output: integer

Rules
- Input must be a positive integer
- Output will also be a positive integer

## Examples
puts sum(23) == 5
puts sum(496) == 19
puts sum(123_456_789) == 45

## Data structures
- array

## Algorithm

Given a positive integer, method will split into an array of digtits. Then the sum of that array of digits will be returned.
