## Problem
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer.

Input: integer > 0
Output: integer

## Examples

>> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
5
>> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product.
s
The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.

>> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
6
>> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product.
p
The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.

## Data Structures
- Array?

## Algorithm
Given a positive, non-zero integer, generate a range or array from 1 to that number. Then solicit user input to determine if all range objects should be added or multiplied together. Initialize total integer and either add or multiply each array item.
