# RB101 Log

Logging my progress so I can see my overall output and have something to commit even on days I'm working purely in the terminal or reading a textbook.

I started this progress log partway through RB101. Newest entries first.

### Day 42: Monday March 29, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Working through the PEDAC process.

**My Feelings:** Mentally tough working through new concepts, trying to give myself the time and space to let it all breathe.

### Day 41: Sunday March 28, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off.

**My Feelings:** Worked almost 14 hours this week, happy with my progress so far. Would like to get to 15-20 if possible.


### Day 40: Saturday March 27, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 Lesson 4, learning about loops and PEDAC.

**My Feelings:** I think I understand loops pretty well now, but writing complex algorithms is still hurting my head.
