# RB101 Log

Logging my progress so I can see my overall output and have something to commit even on days I'm working purely in the terminal or reading a textbook.

I started this progress log partway through RB101. Newest entries first.

### Day 40: Saturday March 27, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 Lesson 4, learning about loops and PEDAC.

**My Feelings:** I think I understand loops pretty well now, but writing complex algorithms is still hurting my head.
