# RB101 Log

Logging my progress so I can see my overall output and have something to commit even on days I'm working purely in the terminal or reading a textbook.

I started this progress log partway through RB101. Newest entries first.

### Day 54: Saturday April 10, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Read a couple articles, worked on a problem that's been eluding me.

**My Feelings:** I was really exhausted today and my day kinda got derailed which threw me off. Still over my minimum for the week, but would like to do more before the week is over.

### Day 53: Friday April 9, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Attended a meetup with the SPOT mods. 

**My Feelings:** It was really great, I feel a lot more confident about (virtually) meeting up with other students now.

### Day 52: Thursday April 8, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Working on Lesson 4's collection method assignments and practice problems. Also did a quick crash course in Markdown, since that came up as a recommendation for exam prep in the chat.

**My Feelings:** Feeling good. Things are starting to connect. I was proud of myself today for recognizing when a method was using short circuit evaluation before looking at the answer. I'm not memorizing everything but I'm starting to understand what's happening and where to look for answers.


### Day 51: Wednesday April 7, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Began assignment on more collection methods.

**My Feelings:** Didn't work as much as I wanted today. Life got in the way. Still adjusting to some major changes and trying to add new responsibilities without necessarily shifting priorities.

### Day 50: Tuesday April 6, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Finished assignment on collection methods.

**My Feelings:** Really nuanced material here but I'm finding it really rewarding to understand the differences in things like return values for these methods.

### Day 49: Monday April 5, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 easy exercises.

**My Feelings:** Got really stuck on Easy 2.8, the solution to which required a method I'm not familiar with. But now my brain really wants to solve it a different way. Will sleep on it.

### Day 48: Sunday April 4, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Today's Progress**: Input some Anki cards, checked my messages, and organized notes.

**My Feelings:** Unexpectedly busy week. Just hit my minimum, though I was planning to do more. Will try to hit the ground running tomorrow.

### Day 47: Saturday April 3, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Completed Easy 1 and began Easy 2 exercises in RB101.

**My Feelings:** These are much easier since the last time I looked at them a few assignments ago, which is a relief. I'm getting the hang of PEDAC by practicing on smaller problems.

### Day 46: Friday April 2, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Loops exercises.

**My Feelings:** Pretty aggravated at how fatigued this vaccine has me feeling. I don't love heading into the weekend with a bunch of chores scheduled and behind in my coursework. Sigh.

### Day 45: Thursday April 1, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Finished RB101 4.5 "The PEDAC Problem Solving Process"

**My Feelings:** This lesson was really time consuming and I was fighting fatigue from my first COVID vaccine shot, but I'm glad I finished. I definitely need some practice implementing PEDAC.

### Days 43 & 44: Tuesday & Wednesday March 30-31, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Days off.

**My Feelings:** Knew I was taking a day off for a day trip on Wednesday but didn't properly account for how much prep work was going to be involved on Tuesday. Needed to sit down and put some more thought into making accomodations for myself.

### Day 42: Monday March 29, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Working through the PEDAC process.

**My Feelings:** Mentally tough working through new concepts, trying to give myself the time and space to let it all breathe.

### Day 41: Sunday March 28, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off.

**My Feelings:** Worked almost 14 hours this week, happy with my progress so far. Would like to get to 15-20 if possible.


### Day 40: Saturday March 27, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 Lesson 4, learning about loops and PEDAC.

**My Feelings:** I think I understand loops pretty well now, but writing complex algorithms is still hurting my head.
