# RB101 Log

Logging my progress so I can see my overall output and have something to commit even on days I'm working purely in the terminal or reading a textbook.

I started this progress log partway through RB101. Newest entries first.

### Day 47: Saturday April 3, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Completed Easy 1 and began Easy 2 exercises in RB101.

**My Feelings:** These are much easier since the last time I looked at them a few assignments ago, which is a relief. I'm getting the hang of PEDAC by practicing on smaller problems.

### Day 46: Friday April 2, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Loops exercises.

**My Feelings:** Pretty aggravated at how fatigued this vaccine has me feeling. I don't love heading into the weekend with a bunch of chores scheduled and behind in my coursework. Sigh.

### Day 45: Thursday April 1, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Finished RB101 4.5 "The PEDAC Problem Solving Process"

**My Feelings:** This lesson was really time consuming and I was fighting fatigue from my first COVID vaccine shot, but I'm glad I finished. I definitely need some practice implementing PEDAC.

### Days 43 & 44: Tuesday & Wednesday March 30-31, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Days off.

**My Feelings:** Knew I was taking a day off for a day trip on Wednesday but didn't properly account for how much prep work was going to be involved on Tuesday. Needed to sit down and put some more thought into making accomodations for myself.

### Day 42: Monday March 29, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Working through the PEDAC process.

**My Feelings:** Mentally tough working through new concepts, trying to give myself the time and space to let it all breathe.

### Day 41: Sunday March 28, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off.

**My Feelings:** Worked almost 14 hours this week, happy with my progress so far. Would like to get to 15-20 if possible.


### Day 40: Saturday March 27, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 Lesson 4, learning about loops and PEDAC.

**My Feelings:** I think I understand loops pretty well now, but writing complex algorithms is still hurting my head.
