# RB101 Log

Logging my progress so I can see my overall output and have something to commit even on days I'm working purely in the terminal or reading a textbook.

I started this progress log partway through RB101. Newest entries first.

### Day 115: Saturday June 19, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Easy 8.4

**My Feelings**: For some reason I really got stuck on this exercise. I think it's because I was very confident in my solution, but did not go through PEDAC and also did not carefully review the exercise criteria. Some day I will lern this lesson and it will stick.

### Day 114: Friday June 18, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: 2 exercises from Easy 8

**My Feelings**: Today I worked on the train, which was fun until I hit a roadblock, then I realized it was a little difficult to work outside of my desk environtment. I still need a pen and paper for some problems.

### Day 113: Thursday June 17, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Finished Easy 7, began Easy 8

**My Feelings**: Some days I feel like I have no time for anything except Launch School and chores and that gets a little bit depressing.

### Day 112: Wednesday June 16, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Started Easy 7 exercises and completed most.

**My Feelings**: I'm feeling encouraged by how easily these exercise solutions are coming to me. I still have a long ways to go but I'm starting to feel more confident with the PEDAC process.

### Day 111: Tuesday June 15, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Well... What happened here?? I prioritized poorly today and gave too much time to other chores which wore me out and left me no time for coding. Trying to have gradually fewer of these days.

### Day 110: Monday June 14, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Easy 6 exercises, watched a video and took notes, made some new Anki cards.

**My Feelings**: I'm tired! It was very rainy today, as can be expected of a Florida summer. Glad we only lost power once and I didn't lose any work.

### Day 109: Sunday June 13, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Spent some time with friends today as I was only 1/2 hour short of my goal. Felt I needed it. This week was tough.

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Had some work planned for the evening but got a migraine.

### Day 107: Friday June 11, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Today's Progress**: Working on Easy 6.7 & 6.8

**My Feelings**: I had a hell of a time wrangling Array#slice and its various syntax variations today! Feel like I learned a bit about debugging but could use a more solid understanding. Definitely not at assessment level yet. Putting in the time though.

### Day 106: Thursday June 10, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Working on Easy 6.1-6.7

**My Feelings**: Finished a bit early today. It definitely feels good  to hit the 12 hour mark before Friday! Especially considering I was a bit under par the last 2 days. 6 poms seems like a good minimum for me.

### Day 105: Wednesday June 9, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Finished Easy 4, just started Easy 6

**My Feelings**: All I did today was pain nap and work and I can't say I loved it. Maybe I'll feel differently about it at the end of the week.

### Day 104: Tuesday June 8, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Finished Easy 5, moved back to reattempt Easy 4 solutions. Almost finished.

**My Feelings**: Kind of a rough pain day today so got a late start. Still managed to hit my 7-10PM study block, so I'm pretty happy with that. Prioritized well, I think.

### Day 103: Monday June 7, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 8

**Today's Progress**: 4-5 exercises in Easy 5

**My Feelings**: Day off. Worked ~14 hours this week.

### Day 101: Saturday June 5, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 2 exercises in Easy 5

**My Feelings**: Worked hard and finished early for the week. Will come back and review flashcards for the weekend. Feels like I could use a rest break to keep going. Trying to proceed at a pace that's sustainable without wrecking my health. Frequent check-ins help.

### Day 100: Friday June 4, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 8

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 3 exercises in Easy 5

**My Feelings**: Only worked on a few exercises today but I'm taking more detailed notes and working out the concepts, so I feel it was fruitful nonetheless. Hard to believe it's been 100 days already. Not quite the pace I wanted to be on but I have to remind myself I'm part-time and still adjusting to the schedule.

### Day 99: Thursday June 3, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 8

**Today's Progress**: Finish reviewing Lesson 5 notes, create new Anki cards, resume RB101 exercises at Easy 5

### Day 98: Wednesday June 2, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 9

**Today's Progress**: Review Lessons 4 and 5 notes, create new Anki cards, synthesize concepts, rewatch video on consistency and take notes.

**My Feelings**: Kinda overdid it today, but had a lot of notes to catch up on. Also took some time to reassess my goals and whether I'm on track. I think it was important to do that.

### Day 97: Tuesday June 1, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Note review.

**My Feelings**: Started on a roll, then started having some pain. Ugh. Starting earlier in the day usually helps me avoid this.

### Day 95-96: Sunday May 30, 2021 - Monday May 31, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Memorial Day holiday. I'm starting to realize my work time is really beholden to my family's schedule. Could write a whole essay about how that intersects with traditional gender roles but I'll save it for the blog. Trying to figure out how to prioritize my own needs.

### Day 94: Saturday May 29, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Attended a Meetup

**My Feelings**: Good meetup, really helpful tips from other students on how to protect my working time.

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Time off for birthday.

### Day 90: Tuesday May 25, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Complete Lesson 5 Quiz

**My Feelings**: I got a 90% on the quiz, my highest quiz score yet! Proud of myself. I decided to just take my time no matter how long it took (5 hours off and on!). I did lose patience and give up too soon on the last question. Though I'm not sure it would have helped to spend much more time on it, this will definitely encourage me to take my time on preparations for the assessments.

### Day 89: Monday May 24, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Complete Lesson 5 practice problems

**My Feelings**: It's Monday!

### Day 87-88: Saturday May 22, 2021 - Sunday May 23, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Weeks like this I have to remind myself that I unexpectedly became a first time parent 2 weeks after starting Core... It's a miracle I can get done as much as I do in that context.

### Day 86: Friday May 21, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Today's Progress**: Checking up on messages

**My Feelings**: Why does the same thing happen to me every week...

### Day 85: Thursday May 20, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Today's Progress**: Checking up on messages

**My Feelings**: The school year is winding down and summer craziness is starting up. Could have managed my time better today.

### Day 84: Wednesday May 19, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Continue work on Lesson 5 practice problems

**My Feelings**: Once again spent a full hour looking at one concept I didn't understand (problem 7) and reading through some forum posts but felt good digging in until I couldn't any more, then moving on. I have a good flow going this week.

### Day 83: Tuesday May 18, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Continue work on Lesson 5 practice problems

**My Feelings**: I swear I spent 3 hours today trying to figure out Enumerable#inject (AGAIN), but was able to move on. I still feel good about my progress today regardless. I'm starting to get a momentum going and 6 poms is starting to feel like too soon to quit, so that's a good sign. Still think it's good to choose a quitting time in advance; I have a propensity to overwork if I'm not careful.

### Day 82: Monday May 17, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Continue work on Lesson 5, starting the practice exercises

**My Feelings**: Still not feeling my best, but a good output today.

### Day 78-81: Thursday May 13, 2021 - Sunday May 16, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Miscellaneous getting caught up

**My Feelings**: Hit a patch of bad health and found it difficult to focus through the pain. Frustrating when I feel like my body won't cooperate with me but next week will be better.

### Day 77: Wednesday May 12, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Finished the blocks assignment in Lesson 5, attended a SPOT study group

**My Feelings**: Today was my first SPOT meetup, and I found it really helpful. I need a lot of practice talking through my answers. Also feeling good that I have a clear plan of action through the end of this week and next week.

### Day 76: Tuesday May 11, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Steady work on Lesson 5. Doing the working with blocks exercises.

**My Feelings**: I feel like it's easiest for me to get into a groove with the written materials, so I'm enjoying this confidence boost while it lasts.

### Day 75: Monday May 10, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Kept hitting walls on the Easy 4 exercises, moved on to begin Lesson 5.

**My Feelings**: I was determined to get off to a good start this week so I'm not working from a deficit. It's amazing how much psychology is involved in my working process. It was also a relief to start a new lesson and find it covered the exact problems I was struggling with last week.

### Day 74: Sunday May 9, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: It was a busy weekend of family obligations. Did break at a cafe to try to get some work done, which it turns out is very difficult to do when the seats are uncomfortable.

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: N/A

### Day 71: Thursday May 6, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Two exercises...again. Catching up on Anki still.

**My Feelings**: I understand why Launch School advises against breaks because my brain feels like sludge. I think I hit just about bug possible in these Easy 4 exercises.

### Day 70: Wednesday May 5, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Two exercises.

**My Feelings**: My household has been really tough to manage the last few days. Just a lot of needs and demands on my time. Trying to figure out how to be more protective of my work time.

### Day 69: Tuesday May 4, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Today's Progress**: Spent far too long trying to figure out how Enumerable#inject works.

**My Feelings**: I think tomorrow I need to move on and revisit that exercise. I just get some anxiety about returning to previous exercises, and how best to keep notes for my future self in that scenario.

### Day 68: Monday May 3, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Bug testing one exercise for literally an hour and catching up on Anki deck.

**My Feelings**: Most of today was spent on a doctor's appointment but did want to hop back in the saddle. Slow start. Hopeful for tomorrow.

*Unofficial break (meaning I didn't unsubscribe) to care for my spouse from 4/23 - 5/2 (10 days). Mixed feelings about putting my studies on hold this early in the program. Will this break the seal, so to speak, for future breaks? Should I have tried harder to hit my minimum study times? But there's really no argument... I had no time or energy for anything else other than running the household and doctor appointments. Regretably, it happens.*

### Day 67: Friday April 23, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings:** My partner's routine eye exam turned into emergency surgery. Needless to say... Did not work.

### Day 66: Thursday April 22, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Began work on Easy 4 exercises.

**My Feelings:** It's tough shifting gears from Lessons to Exercises, but I do feel my brain expanding, so that must be a good thing.

### Day 65: Wednesday April 21, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Complete Easy 3 exercises.

**My Feelings:** Work was slow-going today, but still learning a lot. COVID vaccine making me very tired and brain foggy.

### Day 64: Tuesday April 20, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Working on Documentation and Easy 3 problem sets, catching up on Anki card creation.

**My Feelings:** I was hesistant to return to the documentation exercises because I did so poorly on the first few, but struggling on the last one actually helped me crack the whole thing wide open and the rest came easily to me. That's the power of MBL, BABY.

### Day 63: Monday April 19, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings:** Planned vacation day.

### Day 62: Sunday April 18, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings:** Already hit my quota for the week. Had planned to work ahead for next week but a migraine took me out of it. Bummer.

### Day 61: Saturday April 17, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Took the RB101 Lesson 4 quiz.

**My Feelings:** I did much worse than I expected on the lesson 2 quiz, so this time aroudn I made sure I was 100% confident in my answers. Unfortunately, I still missed 4 questions even though I was confident I got 100%. Will need to make sure in the future to spend more time studying for and working on quizzes.

### Day 60: Friday April 16, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Finished reviewing pass by reference vs. pass by value. Wrapped up RB101 Lesson 4.

**My Feelings:** I'm officially 2 months into my LaunchSchool studies! I'm just wrapping up RB101 Lesson 4, so I feel I'm making pretty good progress considering I'm part time, though the temptation is strong to compare myself to others. The true measure is that I feel I'm reinforcing and growing my knowledge every day.

### Day 59: Thursday April 15, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Reread the Lesson 2 articles on pass by reference vs. pass by value.

**My Feelings:** Wasn't sure if this was going to be productive, but I actually do find I'm understanding better on a second pass. Or it's at least reinforcing that I understand more than I think, and picking up on more subtle details.

### Day 58: Wednesday April 14, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Listened to a few podcast episodes, worked on Lesson 4.11 problems.

**My Feelings:** Well today included unexpected news of a COVID exposure and waiting in line for tests, so I tried to make the best of my time by continuing to catch up on the Launch School podcast. However, working on problems in the evening after a long day proved frustrating. Just felt like I couldn't arrive at the right answers. Will try again tomorrow.

### Day 57: Tuesday April 13, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed how to read Ruby documentation, learned the difference between core and std-lib, finished some exercises, and puzzled on the return value of if statements

**My Feelings:** In this program I've noticed that time flies when I'm confused as hell. I swear I spent an hour on how to read documentation today and most of it felt like spinning my wheels. But the information that's hardest won seems to be the most valuable, which I guess shouldn't be surprising. I felt like I discovered a new planet when I finally figured out std-lib is different than core and why I was having such a hard time finding the damn Date module.

### Day 56: Monday April 12, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Worked on RB101 Exercises.

**My Feelings:** I was hoping I had improved, but the Documentation exercises are still really hard for me. A little frustrated today since our internet was out most of the day due to electrician work.

### Day 55: Sunday April 11, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Attended a Women Who Code meetup.

**My Feelings:** Met my quota for this week. Feeling pretty good about it. Still want to step it up over time but for now it feels close to being just right.

### Day 54: Saturday April 10, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Read a couple articles, worked on a problem that's been eluding me.

**My Feelings:** I was really exhausted today and my day kinda got derailed which threw me off. Still over my minimum for the week, but would like to do more before the week is over.

### Day 53: Friday April 9, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Attended a meetup with the SPOT mods. 

**My Feelings:** It was really great, I feel a lot more confident about (virtually) meeting up with other students now.

### Day 52: Thursday April 8, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Working on Lesson 4's collection method assignments and practice problems. Also did a quick crash course in Markdown, since that came up as a recommendation for exam prep in the chat.

**My Feelings:** Feeling good. Things are starting to connect. I was proud of myself today for recognizing when a method was using short circuit evaluation before looking at the answer. I'm not memorizing everything but I'm starting to understand what's happening and where to look for answers.


### Day 51: Wednesday April 7, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Began assignment on more collection methods.

**My Feelings:** Didn't work as much as I wanted today. Life got in the way. Still adjusting to some major changes and trying to add new responsibilities without necessarily shifting priorities.

### Day 50: Tuesday April 6, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Finished assignment on collection methods.

**My Feelings:** Really nuanced material here but I'm finding it really rewarding to understand the differences in things like return values for these methods.

### Day 49: Monday April 5, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 easy exercises.

**My Feelings:** Got really stuck on Easy 2.8, the solution to which required a method I'm not familiar with. But now my brain really wants to solve it a different way. Will sleep on it.

### Day 48: Sunday April 4, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Today's Progress**: Input some Anki cards, checked my messages, and organized notes.

**My Feelings:** Unexpectedly busy week. Just hit my minimum, though I was planning to do more. Will try to hit the ground running tomorrow.

### Day 47: Saturday April 3, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Completed Easy 1 and began Easy 2 exercises in RB101.

**My Feelings:** These are much easier since the last time I looked at them a few assignments ago, which is a relief. I'm getting the hang of PEDAC by practicing on smaller problems.

### Day 46: Friday April 2, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Loops exercises.

**My Feelings:** Pretty aggravated at how fatigued this vaccine has me feeling. I don't love heading into the weekend with a bunch of chores scheduled and behind in my coursework. Sigh.

### Day 45: Thursday April 1, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Finished RB101 4.5 "The PEDAC Problem Solving Process"

**My Feelings:** This lesson was really time consuming and I was fighting fatigue from my first COVID vaccine shot, but I'm glad I finished. I definitely need some practice implementing PEDAC.

### Days 43 & 44: Tuesday & Wednesday March 30-31, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Days off.

**My Feelings:** Knew I was taking a day off for a day trip on Wednesday but didn't properly account for how much prep work was going to be involved on Tuesday. Needed to sit down and put some more thought into making accomodations for myself.

### Day 42: Monday March 29, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Working through the PEDAC process.

**My Feelings:** Mentally tough working through new concepts, trying to give myself the time and space to let it all breathe.

### Day 41: Sunday March 28, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off.

**My Feelings:** Worked almost 14 hours this week, happy with my progress so far. Would like to get to 15-20 if possible.


### Day 40: Saturday March 27, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 Lesson 4, learning about loops and PEDAC.

**My Feelings:** I think I understand loops pretty well now, but writing complex algorithms is still hurting my head.
