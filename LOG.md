# RB101 Log

Logging my progress so I can see my overall output and have something to commit even on days I'm working purely in the terminal or reading a textbook.

I started this progress log partway through RB101. Newest entries first.

### Day 59: Thursday April 15, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Reread the Lesson 2 articles on pass by reference vs. pass by value.

**My Feelings:** Wasn't sure if this was going to be productive, but I actually do find I'm understanding better on a second pass. Or it's at least reinforcing that I understand more than I think, and picking up on more subtle details.

### Day 58: Wednesday April 14, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Listened to a few podcast episodes, worked on Lesson 4.11 problems.

**My Feelings:** Well today included unexpected news of a COVID exposure and waiting in line for tests, so I tried to make the best of my time by continuing to catch up on the Launch School podcast. However, working on problems in the evening after a long day proved frustrating. Just felt like I couldn't arrive at the right answers. Will try again tomorrow.

### Day 57: Tuesday April 13, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed how to read Ruby documentation, learned the difference between core and std-lib, finished some exercises, and puzzled on the return value of if statements

**My Feelings:** In this program I've noticed that time flies when I'm confused as hell. I swear I spent an hour on how to read documentation today and most of it felt like spinning my wheels. But the information that's hardest won seems to be the most valuable, which I guess shouldn't be surprising. I felt like I discovered a new planet when I finally figured out std-lib is different than core and why I was having such a hard time finding the damn Date module.

### Day 56: Monday April 12, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Worked on RB101 Exercises.

**My Feelings:** I was hoping I had improved, but the Documentation exercises are still really hard for me. A little frustrated today since our internet was out most of the day due to electrician work.

### Day 55: Sunday April 11, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Attended a Women Who Code meetup.

**My Feelings:** Met my quota for this week. Feeling pretty good about it. Still want to step it up over time but for now it feels close to being just right.

### Day 54: Saturday April 10, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Read a couple articles, worked on a problem that's been eluding me.

**My Feelings:** I was really exhausted today and my day kinda got derailed which threw me off. Still over my minimum for the week, but would like to do more before the week is over.

### Day 53: Friday April 9, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Attended a meetup with the SPOT mods. 

**My Feelings:** It was really great, I feel a lot more confident about (virtually) meeting up with other students now.

### Day 52: Thursday April 8, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Working on Lesson 4's collection method assignments and practice problems. Also did a quick crash course in Markdown, since that came up as a recommendation for exam prep in the chat.

**My Feelings:** Feeling good. Things are starting to connect. I was proud of myself today for recognizing when a method was using short circuit evaluation before looking at the answer. I'm not memorizing everything but I'm starting to understand what's happening and where to look for answers.


### Day 51: Wednesday April 7, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Began assignment on more collection methods.

**My Feelings:** Didn't work as much as I wanted today. Life got in the way. Still adjusting to some major changes and trying to add new responsibilities without necessarily shifting priorities.

### Day 50: Tuesday April 6, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Finished assignment on collection methods.

**My Feelings:** Really nuanced material here but I'm finding it really rewarding to understand the differences in things like return values for these methods.

### Day 49: Monday April 5, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 easy exercises.

**My Feelings:** Got really stuck on Easy 2.8, the solution to which required a method I'm not familiar with. But now my brain really wants to solve it a different way. Will sleep on it.

### Day 48: Sunday April 4, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Today's Progress**: Input some Anki cards, checked my messages, and organized notes.

**My Feelings:** Unexpectedly busy week. Just hit my minimum, though I was planning to do more. Will try to hit the ground running tomorrow.

### Day 47: Saturday April 3, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Completed Easy 1 and began Easy 2 exercises in RB101.

**My Feelings:** These are much easier since the last time I looked at them a few assignments ago, which is a relief. I'm getting the hang of PEDAC by practicing on smaller problems.

### Day 46: Friday April 2, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Loops exercises.

**My Feelings:** Pretty aggravated at how fatigued this vaccine has me feeling. I don't love heading into the weekend with a bunch of chores scheduled and behind in my coursework. Sigh.

### Day 45: Thursday April 1, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Today's Progress**: Finished RB101 4.5 "The PEDAC Problem Solving Process"

**My Feelings:** This lesson was really time consuming and I was fighting fatigue from my first COVID vaccine shot, but I'm glad I finished. I definitely need some practice implementing PEDAC.

### Days 43 & 44: Tuesday & Wednesday March 30-31, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Days off.

**My Feelings:** Knew I was taking a day off for a day trip on Wednesday but didn't properly account for how much prep work was going to be involved on Tuesday. Needed to sit down and put some more thought into making accomodations for myself.

### Day 42: Monday March 29, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Working through the PEDAC process.

**My Feelings:** Mentally tough working through new concepts, trying to give myself the time and space to let it all breathe.

### Day 41: Sunday March 28, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off.

**My Feelings:** Worked almost 14 hours this week, happy with my progress so far. Would like to get to 15-20 if possible.


### Day 40: Saturday March 27, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on RB101 Lesson 4, learning about loops and PEDAC.

**My Feelings:** I think I understand loops pretty well now, but writing complex algorithms is still hurting my head.
